This repository explores the use of adaptive basis functions in Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Neural Networks (KANs), focusing on improving the approximation capabilities and efficiency of these models. The research aims to refine the representation of multivariate functions by leveraging adaptive techniques for basis function selection, addressing key challenges in approximation theory and practical implementation.
